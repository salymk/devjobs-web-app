## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this jobs board using a local `data.json` to retrieve the data. The goal was to try to get the project looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React ROuter v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview) - Routing
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) - Fetch, cache and update data in React

### What I learned

I had a lot of fun working on this project, and there's a bunch of things I tried in the project, like styled-components, URL search params, Material UI, and using prefers-color-scheme and local storage for handling dark mode.

### Continued development

I plan to turn this into a fullstack app, users will be able to sign up and create jobs.
